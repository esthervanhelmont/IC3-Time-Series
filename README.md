# IC3-Time-Series

This analysis compared several time series forecasting models to predict weekly revenue trends.
While the ARIMA model captured the overall trend, it failed to reflect seasonal fluctuations.
The SARIMA model, which accounts for seasonality, achieved the lowest error scores (MAE = 3.48, RMSE = 4.44, MAPE = 6.58%) and proved the most accurate and stable.
Alternative models such as SARIMAX and XARIMA did not add meaningful improvement.
The final SARIMA forecast was exported to Excel for future analysis and visualization.
